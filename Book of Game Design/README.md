# Book: Game Startup Manual: Game Design 

Back in my studying time, I want to learn about game design. So, I wrote some notes after reading some game design books. Eventually, the notes became this book. The book is published on Amazon, and there is a free version of it as well in GitHub: https://github.com/ardiawanbagusharisa/gamestartupmanual.
