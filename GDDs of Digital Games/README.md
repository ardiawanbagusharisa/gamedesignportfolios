# GDDs of Digital Games 

This directory contains my past portfolios of game design, GDD. There is a readme file in each directory where it shows the video of the project. 

## 1. MECH.AI 

MECH.AI is an isometric top-down & , turn-based strategy game with the narration of the player will play as the pilot for a race to get the hidden currency in planets due to the lack of resources on Earth. Originally, this game serve as research object including but not limitted to game AI and procedural content generation. Together with my students, I responsible as the project manager and lead game designer, so that includes scheduling the meeting to critically advising the design alternatives. 

## 2. Neverinth 

Neverinth is actually an abbreviation of never ending labyrinth, and a game developed by Creact (Taiwanese company) . Specifically, me and one friend work as AI programmer to create a procedural dungeon module using shape grammar. 

## 3. Witch Football 

Witch football is a fun portfolio because in this project I work alone to create the game design and the game program implementation as well as music and art, except the pinup sprites. Here, I learn the deeper detail on how to create better design pattern and effective workflow. Having the knowledge of both game design, game programming, and a little foundation of art is so beneficial. 

## 4. Ramayana 

Ramayana is my very old portfolio of 2D platformer where I need to implement parallax system to create blurry foreground effect, and also narrative aspect as the player progresses. I work as a game designer and programmer, while my friend as the artist. 

## 5. Blockout Level Design  

This is an example of compilation of level blockout rather than a GDD.
